# LZWCompression
Implements the LZW Compression algorithm. 

## Thoughts and bugs
Seems to work fine for the most part but when tried with large file (Moby Dick) the decompressed file fails to match the original file halfway through

If anyone knows whats wrong or can advise, please create an issue and let me know! I will be so grateful.

Warmest,
Winston
